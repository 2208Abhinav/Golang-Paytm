## What it is? 

It is a well managed repository, using which one can integrate Patym in their GoLang Website in quick simple steps once they get Paytm Merchant Key from Paytm official website.

## Prerequisite

1. Create a merchant account in Paytm.
2. Get PAYTM_MERCHANT_KEY  which will be get once the onboarding process is completed.

## Steps to Follow 

1. Set Up Merchant Key got from above process

    Provide the value for PAYTM_MERCHANT_KEY in .env file
    ```
    PAYTM_MID = "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
    PAYTM_MERCHANT_KEY = "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
    PAYTM_CHANNEL_ID = "WAP"
    PAYTM_CHANNEL_ID_WEB = "WEB"
    PAYTM_WEBSITE = "XXXXXXX"
    PAYTM_WEBSITE_WEB = "XXXXX"
    PAYTM_INDUSTRY_TYPE_ID = "XXX"
    ```

2. Verify Checksum Hash for successful transactions.

    A checksum hash is generated by the paytm which is verified on merchant server for successful transaction.
For this there is a file library.go in Paytm folder which need to be copied to your local as it works for generation and verification of checksum.

3. Set Mode

    Paytm integration can be done in two stages i.e. staging and production modes have different Paytm transaction urls.

    * Staging mode transaction url *
    PAYTM_TXN_URL = "https://securegw-stage.paytm.in/theia/processTransaction"
    PAYTM_TXN_STATUS_URL = `https://securegw-stage.paytm.in/merchant-status/getTxnStatus`

    * Production mode transaction url *
    PAYTM_TXN_URL_STAGE = "https://secure.paytm.in/oltp-web/processTransaction"
    PAYTM_TXN_STATUS_URL_STAGE = `https://securegw-stage.paytm.in/merchant-status/getTxnStatus`
